Movie Review Analysis using NLP

Objective: Analyze movie reviews to determine sentiment (positive/negative) and extract insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Libraries Used:

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing and tokenization
- spaCy for advanced text processing and entity recognition
- scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models

Models Used:

- Supervised Learning Models:
    - Logistic Regression for sentiment classification
    - Random Forest Classifier for sentiment classification
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM) for sentiment classification
- Deep Learning Models:
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for text classification
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for text classification
    - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification

NLP Techniques Used:

- Text Preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization
- Feature Extraction: Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Sentiment Analysis: rule-based approach, machine learning approach

Steps Involved:

1. Data Collection: gather movie reviews from various sources
2. Data Preprocessing: clean and preprocess text data
3. Feature Extraction: extract relevant features from text data
4. Model Training: train machine learning/deep learning models
5. Model Evaluation: evaluate model performance using metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
6. Sentiment Analysis: analyze sentiment of movie reviews using trained models

Insights Gained:

- Overall sentiment of movie reviews
- Common themes and topics discussed in reviews
- Sentiment analysis of specific aspects (acting, direction, plot, etc.)
- Comparison of sentiment across different movies or genres
